## Project Details

- **Project Code**: MVP_22
- **Domain**: mornhub.dev
- **Type**: Frontend Application

## DeepSeek AI Configuration

This project now uses DeepSeek AI for code generation. To configure it:

### 1. Get DeepSeek API Key
1. Visit [DeepSeek Platform](https://platform.deepseek.com/)
2. Sign up for an account
3. Get your API key from the dashboard

### 2. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root and add:

```env
# DeepSeek AI Configuration
DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=your_deepseek_api_key_here
DEEPSEEK_BASE_URL=https://api.deepseek.com

# Optional: Model configuration
DEEPSEEK_MODEL=deepseek-chat
DEEPSEEK_MAX_TOKENS=4000
DEEPSEEK_TEMPERATURE=0.7
```

### 3. Restart the Application
After configuring the environment variables, restart your development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### API Endpoints Updated
- `/api/generate` - Main code generation using DeepSeek AI (via OpenAI SDK)
- `/api/preview` - Live preview generation
- `/api/preview-simple` - Simple preview generation
- `/api/preview-debug` - Debug preview generation

All endpoints now use DeepSeek AI with OpenAI SDK instead of local template generation.
